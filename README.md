What external libraries did I use?

- PrimeNG, which is my favourite Angular component library;
- Tailwind CSS, to style what PrimeNG couldn't. More efficient than SCSS - less code, not moving between HTML and SCSS files;
- File-saver and XLSX, to export shifts to Excel files;
- Fireabse, to store, sync, and query data from everywhere.

Features of Angular used:

- template driven forms;
- services, observables,
- some new Angular syntax @ngIf;
- rxJS, for reactive programming;
- pipes;
