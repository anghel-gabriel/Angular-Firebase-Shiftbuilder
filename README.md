External libraries I used:

- PrimeNG, which is my favourite Angular component library;
- Tailwind CSS, to style what PrimeNG couldn't. More efficient than SCSS - less code, not moving between HTML and SCSS files;
- File-saver and XLSX, to export shifts to Excel files;
- Firebase, to handle authentication, to store, sync, and query data from everywhere.
- chart.js.

Features of Angular used:

- template driven forms;
- services, observables,
- some new Angular syntax (e.g. @ngIf);
- rxJS, for reactive programming;
- pipes (mostly date pipe variations);
- guards;

What could have done better:

- add security rules;
- improve fetching;
- improve type checking;
